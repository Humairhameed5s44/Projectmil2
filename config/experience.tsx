             FreeCodeCamp has been instrumental in helping me develop my coding skills from the ground up
             Through its structured, project-based curriculum  I learned foundational programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as more advanced topics like responsive web design, data structures, algorithms, and front-end libraries. FreeCodeCampâ€™s hands-on approach, combined with its supportive community and wealth of coding challenges, has allowed me to practice coding regularly and build real-world projects that showcase my progress. This platform has not only equipped me with technical skills but also given me the confidence to tackle complex coding problems and continue advancing in software development.
